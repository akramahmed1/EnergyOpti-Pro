6. User Journey
Role	Step-by-Step Flow
Energy Manager	Logs in (OAuth) → accesses /predict → inputs BESS data → reviews/export cost-saving predictions
Trader	Logs in → uses /quantum for forecasts → adjusts trading strategies
Utility Operator	Monitors /iot for grid status → adjusts VPP settings
ESG Officer	Views dashboard → generates /carbon compliance reports
CTO/Admin	Oversees /quantum twin → checks system logs via admin panel
