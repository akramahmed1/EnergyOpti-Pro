  - Open Refact.ai chat, paste prompt, monitor RL in /predict, /forecast API with geopolitical risk AI, Unified AI Hub, Alert Rules Engine backend.
  - Test locally: `uvicorn main:app --reload`, use Postman for /predict, /forecast.
  - Commit/push: `git add .`, `git commit -m "feat: RL, forecast with risk AI, AI hub, alerts backend"`, `git push origin main`.

- **July 12 (12 hours)**:
  - Continue with Scheduled ESG Reporting, holographic mobile-responsive dashboard, nuclear-renewable hybrids, autonomous energy bots.
  - Test, commit/push: `git add .`, `git commit -m "feat: ESG reporting, mobile dashboard, nuclear hybrids, energy bots"`, `git push origin main`.

- **July 13 (12 hours)**:
  - Setup Fly.io deployment, fix CI/CD (update `main.py` to `from pyjwt import JWTError, jwt`, test, push).
  - Add holographic UI components, finalize.
  - Test, commit/push: `git add .`, `git commit -m "chore: Fly.io, CI fix, holographic UI"`, `git push origin main`.

- **Post-MVP (July 15+)**: Real-time market data, custom strategies, blockchain, scalability, Advanced AI Integration, etc.
- Use Refact.ai with prompt: "Integrate Unified AI Hub, /forecast API with geopolitical risk AI, Scheduled ESG Reporting, Alert Rules Engine with autonomous bots, holographic mobile-responsive dashboard, holographic UI, nuclear-renewable hybrids into EnergyOpti-Pro per updated PRD. Use React, Qiskit-aer time-series, email, Slack, Three.js, pyjwt. Log outputs, test, commit/push. Timeline: July 11-13, 2025."
